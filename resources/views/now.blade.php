        I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.dayforce.com/">Dayforce</a> building things
        with
        .NET and working on their security platform. Security is fun, and catching internet bad guys can be quite
        fulfilling.

        I'm working on a <a href="https://github.com/hetzner-cloud-php/client">PHP client</a> for the Hetzner Cloud API.
        The goal is to make server management with Hetzner a breeze with PHP and learn a few things along the way.
