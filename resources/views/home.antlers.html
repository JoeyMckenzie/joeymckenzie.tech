                I'm a software developer based in Northern California. I enjoy
                writing about software, design, dad jokes, and cheap beer. I
                like building for the web, open source, learning new things, and
                professional wrestling. I enjoy writing about my adventures in
                software and the things I'm currently working on, exploring new
                technologies, and convincing people that PHP is, in fact, not
                completely dead yet.
