I've been having a lot of fun recently messing around with [Leptos](https://leptos.dev), a web assembly-powered full stack
web framework for Rust that feels _a lot_ like [Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/), reactive signals and all.

In fact, this very [website you're reading](https://github.com/JoeyMckenzie/joeymckenzie.tech) from is powered by Leptos.
Needless to say, in a world full of innovative JS-less solutions for the frontend, Leptos deserves a spot near the top
due to it's awesome DX, documentation, and active community. I won't tout the framework too much, but you should definitely
check it out if you're looking to embrace full stack Rust. Leptos has a bunch of awesome features that makes it feel like
Rust-flavored Next.js/Nuxt.js/SvelteKit/[insert meta framework here], from server functions and signals, to progressively enhanced forms and SSR.
