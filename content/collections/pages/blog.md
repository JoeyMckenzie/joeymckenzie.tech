I'm a software developer based in Northern California. I enjoy writing about software, design, dad jokes, and cheap beer. I like building for the web, open source, learning new things, and professional wrestling. I enjoy writing about my adventures in software and the things I'm currently working on, exploring new technologies, and convincing people that PHP is, in fact, not completely dead yet.
