I'm currently a Senior Developer at [Givebutter](https://www.givebutter.com/) building things with PHP and Laravel. Our goal is to make the world a better place and empower the changemaker in all of us. If you're a non-profit, or just looking to give to a cause near and dear to yourself, check us out!

In my spare time, I write a lot of PHP and enjoy tinkering on ideas with Laravel. I've got quite a few fun projects I've worked on that usually make their way over to the blog. A few of my recent favorites:

- A [PHP client](https://github.com/hetzner-cloud-php/client) for Hetzner Cloud API
- A [PHPStan extension](https://github.com/joeymckenzie/nasastan) to bring NASA's Power of Ten rules into your PHP code
- A [Laravel integration](https://github.com/joeymckenzie/givebutter-laravel) for Givebutter

I also run a [digital agency](https://doghead.digital) with my amazing wife. Together, we build websites for small businesses with PHP, Laravel, and Statamic. Our CHO, Moose (a dog), provides most of the home office morale.
