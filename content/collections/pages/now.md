I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Dayforce](https://www.dayforce.com/) building things with .NET and working on their security platform. Security is fun, and catching internet bad guys can be quite fulfilling.

In my spare time, I'm a PHP enjoyer tinkering on ideas with Laravel. I'm working on a [PHP client](https://github.com/hetzner-cloud-php/client) for the Hetzner Cloud API. The goal is to make server management with Hetzner a breeze with PHP and learn a few things along the way. I also recently wrote a [PHPStan extension](https://github.com/joeymckenzie/nasastan) to bring NASA's Power of Ten rules into your PHP code. Contributors welcome!

I run a [digital agency](https://doghead.digital) with my amazing wife. Together, we build websites for small businesses with PHP, Laravel, and Statamic.
