I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at Dayforce building things with .NET and working on their security platform. Security is fun, and catching internet bad guys can be quite fulfilling.

I'm working on a [PHP client](https://github.com/hetzner-cloud-php/client) for the Hetzner Cloud API. The goal is to make server management with Hetzner a breeze with PHP and learn a few things along the way.

I'm recently wrote a [PHPStan extension](https://github.com/joeymckenzie/nasastan) to bring NASA's Power of Ten rules into your PHP code. Contributors welcome!

I run a webdev agency with my amazing wife. Together, we build websites for small businesses with PHP, Laravel, and Statamic.
