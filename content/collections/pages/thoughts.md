Random long form thoughts and short essays that are too long for X, Bluesky, etc. yet I have to get out of my head. Mostly bad takes on software as an industry, cool things I happen to stumble upon, and ideas I need to see in written form to convince myself they're definitely not worth wasting a weekend (or three) to build.
